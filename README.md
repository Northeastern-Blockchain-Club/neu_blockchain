## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. Install npm packages!  
   You can do this with either  
    <code> npm install </code> or
   <code> yarn</code> in ther terminal. Note: You must have node installed in your system. If you don't, [try here.](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
   Traditionally, Gatsby works better with yarn, but this depends on your system as well. Either will most likely work well.

2. **Start developing.**

   Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

   ```shell
   cd neu_blockchain
   npm run develop
   ```

3. **Open the code and start customizing!**

   Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

   Edit `src/pages/index.js` to see your site update in real-time!

### Some notes:

This site is ran hosted on netlify on their free tier. For access, ask me. It really should be placed in a general account for the blockchain eboard team, since it has some bits and pieces in there.

Gatsby can be finicky. If you make a change and don't see it, try a hard reload in the browser (control shift R)

Like any react site, try not to have too many un-used imports. Or any software. If you're even reading this README, you are likely a programmer, so you already almost certainly know this. Fight the bloat. ðŸ’ª

Gatsby is used because quite frankly, it's FAST. Try using lighthouse in your f12 console. At a minimum, it should be scoring 90's.

Also, Gatsby has a really, really good built in GraphQL system. Pages can be autogenerated off of it, so if the team wants to do a blog, this is an awesome choice, and the docs show exactly how to do it. I once migrated a 6000 page site to Gatsby, and it would still load under 3 seconds for all the data in the graphQL data layer. Seriously good.
